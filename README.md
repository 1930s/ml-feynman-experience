> "What I cannot create, I do not understand" - Feynman.

This is a collection of concepts I tried to implement with Python on [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). If you want to play with the code, feel free to copy the notebook and have fun.

### Work in progress
